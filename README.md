# Friend-function

//Friend function:
/*
   sometimes it becomes neccessery to have access of private and protected members of class outside class.
   this is achieved by using friend function. if we make class B friend of class A then class B can access private and protected members 
   of class A.
*/
//friend function can be memeber of another class or A global function

//points about friend fucntion:
/*
  1. Too many friend function or external classes declared as a friend of private and protected data lessen the value of encapsulation in oops
  2. friendship is not inherited .
  3. friendship is not mutual . if Class B is friend of class A then reverse is not true.
